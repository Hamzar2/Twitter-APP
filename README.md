# Decentralized Social Media Platform Report

This repo enables a decentralized social media platform where users can connect their Ethereum wallets, publish posts, and interact with posts from other users. Here’s a breakdown of the core features:

## 1. Wallet Connection
Users start by connecting their Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, to the platform. This connection allows users to interact with blockchain-based content and verifies their identity by linking their Ethereum address to their activity on the platform. Once connected, the user’s wallet address is displayed, and existing posts are loaded for viewing.

## 2. Publishing Posts
Users can create and share their posts on the platform. The post content is inputted through an interface, and once submitted, it’s published directly to the blockchain. This ensures that posts are securely stored and accessible to other users. After publishing, the post feed is updated to display the latest content.

## 3. Interacting with Posts
Users can engage with posts by liking, disliking, or, if they are the post’s author, editing the content. Each interaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and permanence. For likes and dislikes, the interface displays the updated counts to reflect real-time engagement. Authors are also able to make changes to their posts, allowing flexibility while maintaining the post’s blockchain record.

## 4. User Interface and Experience
The platform provides a seamless user experience by dynamically updating the post feed and displaying interactive elements for each post, such as the like and dislike buttons, edit options, and timestamped author details. Additionally, an introductory message welcomes users to the platform, enhancing the initial experience by guiding them through the connection process.
